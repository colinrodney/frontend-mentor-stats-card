# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

## Thanks for viewing my project which is also a front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

The challenge

The challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I completed this project using the following:
HTML
A Custom CSS stylesheet
Bootstrap v5.0.2

Starting w/ the end in mind...

The ultimate goal of this challenge is for uses to be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

Getting to work

My process:
A. Research
Before starting any project I always look over the finished product with a watchful eye to pick out the "easy-to-miss" things first so that I don't skip over them.

B. Design:
Since i'm not totally comfortable with Figma (yet) I draw a wireframe/ prototype of the layout of the project by hand. This allows me to think critically about the layout and the choices i'll use for the design (grid/ flexbox etc...)

C. Develop
Now that I have a "high-level overview" of how the project needs to be laid out, it's now time to begin putting the pieces together!

What I learned

I learned that Bootstrap is a powerful frontend library that really simplifies the development process in terms of speed as well as layout. (The grid system is AWESOME!) I do think sometimes Bootstrap can be a bit of a "bully" as it relates to overriding its classes and allowing for more customization ( I think I just need to learn more about how to use it) and I am still " on the fence" about Bootstrap's classnames cluttering the HTML. Overall I like it, I just need to learn how to take more control of it.

Continued-development

    When I have a bit more OOP under my belt perhaps i'll revisit this project and make the stats section update dynamically...??
