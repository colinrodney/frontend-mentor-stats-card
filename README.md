## Building the project(START HERE...)

Before starting any project I always look over the finished product with a watchful eye to pick out the "easy-to-miss" things first so that I don't skip over them. Since i'm not totally comfortable with Figma (yet) I draw a wireframe/ prototype of the layout of the project by hand. This allows me to think critically about the layout and the choices i'll use for the design (grid/ flexbox etc...).

Once I have the layout for both mobile and desktop screens planned out I can now begin structuring the markup for the project.
